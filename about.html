    <h1>About the Astrological Graph Application</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            This application allows users to generate an astrological graph based on Vedic astrology principles. It visualizes the relationships between planets and houses, aspects, and calculates a total friendliness score among the planets.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            Users input the positions of the planets in the twelve houses of the zodiac, along with the Ascendant sign. The application then:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculates the dynamic house lords based on the Ascendant sign.</li>
            <li>Determines the natural and temporary relationships between the planets.</li>
            <li>Calculates a compound relationship and a total friendliness score.</li>
            <li>Generates a visual graph displaying the planets, houses, and their interconnections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding the Graph</h2>
        <p>
            The graph displays nodes representing planets and houses. Edges (lines) between the nodes represent different types of relationships, each indicated by a specific color:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="legend-color" style="background-color: red;"></span> <strong>Red Edges</strong>: Lordship relationships (Planet → House it lords over)</li>
            <li><span class="legend-color" style="background-color: blue;"></span> <strong>Blue Edges</strong>: Aspect relationships (Planet → Planet it aspects)</li>
            <li><span class="legend-color" style="background-color: green;"></span> <strong>Green Edges</strong>: Same house relationships (Planets in the same house)</li>
            <li><span class="legend-color" style="background-color: #aaa;"></span> <strong>Gray Edges</strong>: Occupies relationships (Planet → House it occupies)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Friendliness Score Calculation</h2>
        <p>
            The total friendliness score is calculated based on the natural and temporary relationships between planets:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Relationships</strong>: Based on traditional Vedic astrology friendships and enmities among planets.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary Relationships</strong>: Determined by the positions of planets in the houses relative to each other.</li>
            <li><strong>Compound Relationships</strong>: Combining natural and temporary relationships to determine the overall relationship between two planets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The score is adjusted using the formula:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
            Adjusted Score = ((Total Score + 65) / 116) × 100%
        </p>
        <p>
            This adjusted score is displayed as a percentage next to the total score.
        </p>

        <h2>Special Conditions in Temporary Relationships</h2>
        <p>
            Additional conditions are considered in temporary relationships:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If one planet is in the 4th house and another in the 10th house, they are temporarily friendly.</li>
            <li>If one planet is in the 2nd house and another in the 12th house, they are temporarily friendly.</li>
            <li>If one planet is in the 3rd house and another in the 11th house, they are temporarily friendly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using the Application</h2>
        <p>
            To use the application:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select your Ascendant sign from the dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>Enter the house positions for each planet (1-12).</li>
            <li>Click "Generate Graph" to view the astrological graph and relationships.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Interpreting the Results</h2>
        <p>
            The graph and relationship matrix provide insights into the interactions among planets in your chart. The total friendliness score gives an overall indication of planetary harmony.
        </p>
